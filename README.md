## About

AstriVerse is a modern WebGL-based framework for showcasing interactive 3D/2D/MAPS models of buildings, campuses, machinery, and equipment integrated with real-time graphs and charts. Developed by Astrikos.AI, this framework empowers decision-makers to quickly derive insights, collaborate effectively, and communicate findings clearly via a modern interactive 3D user interface, making data more accessible, visually engaging, and actionable.

Our platform combines powerful 3D visualization capabilities with real-time data integration, creating an immersive and intuitive environment for data analysis and exploration. Whether you're planning urban infrastructure, managing emergency services, optimizing supply chains, or creating compelling data narratives, AstriVerse provides the tools to transform complex datasets into interactive visual experiences.
